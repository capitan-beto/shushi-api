# Fake Sushi Store API

This project is a REST API inspired by [FakeStore API](https://github.com/keikaavousi/fake-store-api) following the idea of offer a resource that can be helpful in the development of an e-commerce or shopping website projects.

# Why? 

The idea came with the need of learn how Spring Boot works so i decided to create a simple monolithic application that offers a similar service as FakeStore API but oriented in the food bussiness.
